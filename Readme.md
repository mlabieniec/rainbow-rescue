# Vanilla JavaScript Game Example

Just a small example of a pure JavaScript (no frameworks or tools) PWA. Uses localstorage and ES2015 classes/OOP and plain CSS for styling and animations. Sound loading/playing is also done with plain/native JavaScript APIs. Add it to home screen on your mobile device!
